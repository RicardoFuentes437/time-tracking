## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I got to work again with CSS Grid, which was very useful for the time tracking cards section, since i don't use it very often i got to learn again how to use and implement it, it was interesting and fun.

### Continued development

I would like to continue working with CSS Grid to learn its full potential, i know there's a lot of things that i don't know about it yet so i think it would be fun to implement them.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is a complete CSS Grid guide, it's very helpful and you can find whatever you need to implement the kind of grid that you need for your project.
